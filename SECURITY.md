# Security Notes

## GitHub Security Alerts

GitHub has detected vulnerabilities in the gem dependencies. The main issues are:

1. **Ruby Version Limitation**: The system Ruby 2.6.0 is limiting our ability to update to the latest secure versions of gems.

2. **GitHub Pages Compatibility**: We're constrained by GitHub Pages' supported gem versions.

## Recommended Actions

### For Local Development:
1. Consider using a Ruby version manager (rbenv, rvm) to install Ruby 3.x
2. Update to latest compatible gem versions

### For Production (GitHub Pages):
The site will still build and deploy securely on GitHub Pages, as GitHub applies security patches to their build environment automatically.

## Current Mitigation:
- The blog is static HTML/CSS/JS with no server-side processing
- No user input is processed 
- No sensitive data is stored
- Content is version controlled

## Future Updates:
When possible, update to:
- Ruby 3.x
- Latest github-pages gem
- Latest security patches for all dependencies
