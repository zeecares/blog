Starting a public account wasn't meant to participate in zero-sum games or waste others' time, but rather because I have some verbose thoughts that I always want to find a way to express, to satisfy my own desire to warm others' hearts.

2016 was my first year of formal work, and on the last day, I want to spend some time talking about my new and old understanding of this world.

## Was 2016 special... ...?
---

Perhaps it was because this year, for the first time, I truly felt the weight of time. The feeling that time is not infinitely abundant and can slip away without notice became particularly acute this year.

Looking back at 2016, several events stand out clearly:

**Brexit** - The UK voted to leave the European Union, a decision that shocked many and marked a significant shift in global politics.

**Trump's Election** - Against all mainstream predictions, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, reflecting deep divisions in American society.

**Personal Growth** - This was my first year in the workforce, transitioning from student life to professional responsibilities. The daily routine of commuting, working, and adapting to corporate culture was both challenging and enlightening.

## Reflections on Freedom

Reading Mill's "On Liberty" this year was particularly meaningful. The tension between individual freedom and collective responsibility became more tangible as I navigated my new professional environment.

The book's central argument - that the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others - resonated deeply with my observations of workplace dynamics and social interactions.

## Looking Forward

As 2016 ends, I'm grateful for the experiences that shaped my understanding of the world beyond academic theory. The transition from university to working life has been a profound teacher, revealing the complexity of human relationships and the challenges of maintaining one's values in professional settings.

The year taught me that idealism and pragmatism need not be mutually exclusive, but finding the balance requires constant reflection and adjustment.

Here's to 2017 and the continued journey of understanding myself and the world around me.
