#### Stay curious, stay humble.

If you can do this, there's really no need to read any of the words below. But because I can't, I need to use writing to organize my thoughts and remind myself.

## Who
---
![](/pic/who.png)

I've always read Wang Xiaobo's books sporadically and fragmentarily. Whenever I pick up "The Golden Age" again, I always feel the joy of reading it for the first time. The name Wang Er comes from there. Binary opposition, yin and yang poles, binary encoding, wave-particle duality, binary mind, being a fool. I really love the character "äºŒ" (er/two), and I might well dedicate an entire discussion to it alone. But I might change my name at any time - if you invite me to chat or drink, whatever you call me, I really won't care.

## What
---
![](/pic/what.png)

I want to understand this world, and I want to express my understanding.

This sounds quite grand, but in reality, it might be as simple as a child asking "why" - pure curiosity without agenda.

## How
---
![](/pic/how.png)

Through reading, thinking, and writing. Through conversation and reflection. Through making mistakes and learning from them.

The process is more important than the destination. The journey of understanding is itself the understanding.

## Why
---
![](/pic/why.png)

Because I believe that genuine curiosity and humble inquiry can make both the inquirer and the world a little better.

Because in a world full of noise, perhaps what we need more is genuine listening and thoughtful response.

Because life is too short not to try to understand it.
