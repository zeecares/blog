I spent some time thinking, and this title "Enemy of Time" was initially written after watching Luo Zhenyu's 2016-2017 New Year speech. I only wanted to discuss the matter at hand, but as I wrote, my own thoughts went through several twists and turns, so I set it aside. Recently, the beloved magazine "Offline" suddenly announced its closure after the Spring Festival, and I lost a channel for exploring the unknown world. Beyond regret and sadness, I felt it even more necessary to sort out my feelings and thoughts.

I hope I can understand the following as clearly as possible:

1. What is the so-called "contemporary world"
2. What is the discourse of consumerism  
3. "Knowledge"
4. "Action"
5. Epilogue - returning to oneself

The audio combines a song written for my departed grandfather with the sounds of making tea and boiling water. The reason for doing this is that if the background "noise" can't be removed, we might as well make that "noise" louder, and louder still. If interested, you might listen.

## The Best and Worst of Times

Charles Dickens opened "A Tale of Two Cities" with those famous lines about it being the best of times and the worst of times. This paradox feels increasingly relevant today. We live in an age of unprecedented access to information, yet we're drowning in noise. We have more ways to connect than ever before, yet loneliness persists. We have powerful tools for learning and creating, yet anxiety about time and productivity seems to dominate our consciousness.

## The Contemporary World

What defines our current moment? Perhaps it's the acceleration of everything - news cycles, product releases, career changes, even relationships. The pace at which we're expected to process information and make decisions has reached a point where thoughtful reflection becomes a luxury few can afford.

Social media platforms compete for our attention with increasingly sophisticated algorithms designed to keep us scrolling, clicking, engaging. But engagement with what? Often, it's engagement for its own sake, divorced from any deeper purpose or meaning.

## Consumerism and Time

Consumer culture has evolved to colonize not just our wallets but our temporal experience. We're sold the fantasy that the right product, service, or experience can save us time, optimize our productivity, or enhance our lives. Yet paradoxically, the mental energy required to research, purchase, and integrate these solutions often exceeds any time saved.

The "knowledge economy" promises that continuous learning and self-improvement will make us more valuable, more successful, more fulfilled. But this creates a new form of anxiety - the fear of falling behind, of not consuming enough content, of missing the next big insight that could transform our lives.

## Knowledge and Action

There's a dangerous gap between consuming information and developing genuine understanding. In our rush to stay informed and updated, we often mistake the accumulation of facts for wisdom, the collection of insights for transformation.

True knowledge requires time - time to digest, reflect, and integrate new ideas with our existing understanding. It requires space between input and output, between learning and applying. But our cultural moment seems to discourage such patience.

## Returning to Oneself

Perhaps the most radical act in our current environment is simply stopping - stepping back from the endless stream of inputs and asking what we actually think, feel, and want. Not what we should think according to the latest article, or what we should want according to market research, but what emerges from our own experience when we give it space to speak.

The enemy of time might not be time itself, but our relationship to it - the way we've allowed external pressures to dictate our temporal experience, the way we've internalized productivity culture's demand for constant optimization.

Maybe the path forward isn't about managing time better, but about reclaiming our right to move at human speed, to think at the pace of understanding rather than the pace of information consumption.

In memory of those publications and spaces that gave us permission to think slowly, deeply, and for ourselves.
