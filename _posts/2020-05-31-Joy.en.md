Writing brings pleasure. Typing counts too. Using words to capture thoughts is a game that never satisfies completely. I think this is a kind of pure joy. Can joy be ranked high or low? The discriminating mind doesn't exist in the first place. Just like you and me, we come from nothing and return to nothing. It's just that when many people have walked a path, the word "road" becomes a meaningful signifier in today's human world.

If a person who uses language becomes aware of the void nature of textual tools themselves, or to put it more radically, only by establishing this premise can their language and writing avoid falling into the realm of complete nonsense. Because recognizing one's own void essence and constantly carrying this awareness, one can then better get along with oneself.

Something that is not contradictory in itself, yet feels counter-intuitive to people - this is the problem with language and writing itself.
