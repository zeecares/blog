I have some self-awareness about the rhythm of my speech. Considering this isn't purely for myself, not a diary locked away in a closet, as I type these words, I try to read from the perspective of an unfamiliar reader. I have made choices, so although my writing still appears unrestrained in length, it has already undergone some pruning.

At work, I was required to read training materials that mentioned our data privacy services. No matter how thoroughly considered, they are compromises within the existing environment. My words, I suppose, are the same.

Getting back to the point, I've previously written some crude thoughts about what it means to "understand" (perhaps they'll be moved here someday). Setting aside whether the reasoning is coherent, I mention this because I have thought a little about this matter of "understanding." At the most basic level, for someone to say they understand something, there needs to be at least a subject and an object. A sentence like "I understand the wind" already has a mystical flavor to it—after all, the wind cannot refute.

Then someone says they understand the person who said that sentence. This becomes even more of a metaphysical question. Though it sounds strange, examples like "I understand the wind" aren't rare in life. "Wind" in that position can be replaced with any artistic work, and that sentence itself can be replaced with any artistic work. Perceptive readers should see that I'm trying to organize rather than complicate things, but regardless of how I defend myself, the above organization must be ineffective—after all, everything becoming more complex the more you organize it goes against intuition. My intention is to point out that this characteristic of becoming more complex through organization is a major feature of "understanding."

When I say I get it, you'd better just nod. If you ask me what I understand, where I get it, I'm afraid I'll have to fabricate a bunch of nonsensical reasoning with the psychology of not wanting to disappoint your expectations. This is exhausting for both parties, so we should nod more.

Building on the previous paragraph, I think I've roughly described that "understanding" is actually very difficult to achieve. If the object of understanding is another person, I'm afraid only shared real experiences between the two can provide a little possibility for "understanding." Even if two people ride the same roller coaster together, their experiences will inevitably differ. If we still insist that "understanding" is impossible in such situations, then perhaps the word "understanding" should be deleted from the dictionary.

Using language is compromise—if telepathic communication were possible, who would need language? We could directly share feelings. So using "understanding" in any context is also a compromise. Of course, saying "I understand you" to someone who rode the same roller coaster involves relatively less compromise. If you only watched someone else ride the roller coaster and then said "I understand you," the compromise here is greater.

Building acute perception of this degree of compromise requires willingness and time. Given the unclear benefits, I even doubt whether anyone is truly interested in cultivating this perception. But that's another story.

We must admit that conversations between people who've ridden the same roller coaster are extremely rare. So in the vast majority of times when we lack shared real experiences, what should we do when we want to say "understand"? The simplest approach: don't use "understand." Don't say you understand someone.

Actually, even between people with shared real experiences, it's best not to use "understand." If you must express that you can empathize with someone's feelings, you could say "I think I can understand a little bit of your feelings." You could call this "understanding" purism.

Of course, my original intention is to advocate for respect for words, to awaken at least a little awareness of linguistic corruption. George Carlin, in a [stand-up routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSp8IyaKCs0), talked about how the two-syllable "shell shock" became the four-syllable "battle fatigue," then became the eight-syllable "operational exhaustion," became the countless-syllable "post-traumatic stress disorder," and finally was simplified to the essentially painless and harmless "PTSD." I cannot explain here what essential connection this example has with linguistic corruption, but this is undoubtedly the best example I can give. (George Carlin is of course ten thousand times more brilliant than my pale retelling.)

If after all I've said, you still want to use "understanding" in life, then... well, you'd better have good perspective and a well-stocked analogy resource library. When introducing "The Butterfly Lovers," you'd better already know "Romeo and Juliet." The ability to analogize provides humanity a little more possibility for mutual understanding. Although, like "understanding," no analogy, no metaphor, no translation is not a compromise. (There's that compromise perception ability again!)
