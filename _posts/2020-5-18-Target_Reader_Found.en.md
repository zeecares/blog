Finding an object for a communication medium is a very difficult task. And this object, to a large extent, determines the paradigm of communication. Focusing on the wrong object, relatively speaking, will lead to inefficient communication in the short term, and in the long term, will in turn affect the thinking model of the information sender (author) themselves.

For a long time, I haven't produced any output. Aside from life's upheavals, this was mainly because I couldn't find a suitable communication object. And this problem was finally solved today.

The imagined recipient of all my output is my future self, trying as much as possible not to consider other factors. (Of course, that state of creation where God freezes time for a condemned prisoner before execution to complete their work is indeed enviable.)

The next problem is that, based on past experience, I'm often ashamed to look back at my own output, and I'm afraid productivity will be extremely low. But I can still turn to Du Kang for help. Not afraid, not afraid.

*Note: Du Kang is a legendary figure in Chinese culture, often associated with the invention of wine.*
